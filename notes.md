READINGS

* I appreciated seeing such an easy to read and understandable, yet more professional, sort of note taking that we've been attempting in this class.

* There are still limitations, but it was interesting for me to compare my understanding of the reading to earlier weeks.

  * I could pretty easily track what Moravec was describing, the steps she was taking. I understood the general direction of her workflow clearer than I had with previous readings.
  
WORK

* After some browsing, I settled on the diaries of Lucy Copland. The writing-while-travelling aspect appealed to me, as I could already envision a map or at least a timeline as a visual presentation of data at the end of all of this.

* Now I have to try to decide which methods to use to explore the data.

  * My initial thoughts are the methods in Week 4. What does Lucy talk about on her travels? Do her topics change as time progresses? Does early travel excitement turn into homesickness?
