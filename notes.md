READINGS

* I appreciated seeing such an easy to read and understandable, yet more professional, sort of note taking that we've been attempting in this class.

* There are still limitations, but it was interesting for me to compare my understanding of the reading to earlier weeks.

  * I could pretty easily track what Moravec was describing, the steps she was taking. I understood the general direction of her workflow clearer than I had with previous readings.
